# Get an image of a person without their PNC ID

## 1. Search for the person's PNC ID

The `GET /persons` endpoint provides the ability to search for a person based on certain attributes such as first name
and last name.

An example curl command to search on the name "John Smith" looks like:

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: some-client-api-key" \
  https://development.integration-api.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk/v1/persons?first_name=John&last_name=Smith \
  --cert client.pem \
  --key client.key
```

This will return a list of [Person](/documentation/api/#schema-person) objects within a `persons` key. Each object
contains identifying associated attributes, for example:

```json
{
  "persons": [
    {
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "dateOfBirth": "1965-12-01",
      "pncId": "2008/0545166T",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the information provided in the API response to identify the relevant person and their PNC ID.

See [searching for a person API endpoint](/documentation/api/#persons-encodedpncid) for more details.

## 2. Get a list of images of the person using their PNC ID

The `GET /v1/persons/{encodedPncId}/images` endpoint returns a descriptive list of all images that are associated with a
person.

URL-encode the person's PNC ID by replacing the forward slash `/` with `%2F` and pass this in as a path parameter to the
endpoint (read [why we URL-encode path parameters that contain forward slashes](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-integration-api/blob/main/docs/adr/0006-url-encode-path-parameters.md)).

An example curl command that returns a list of images associated with the PNC ID `2008/0545166T` looks like:

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: some-client-api-key" \
  https://development.integration-api.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk/v1/persons/2008%2F0545166T/images \
  --cert client.pem \
  --key client.key
```

This will return a list of [Image](/documentation/api/#schema-image) objects within a `images` key. Each object,
alongside information about the properties of the image, includes an ID that can be used to retrieve the image itself in
JPEG format. For example:

```json
{
  "images": [
    {
      "id": 2461788,
      "view": "FACE",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

Use the information provided in the API response to identify the relevant image and its ID.

See [getting a list of images for a person API endpoint](/documentation/api/#persons-encodedpncid-images) for more
details.

## 3. Get an image using an ID

The `GET images/{id}` endpoint returns the image with the associated ID.

Pass the image ID in as a path parameter to the endpoint.

An example curl command that returns an image associated with the ID `2461788` looks like:

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: some-client-api-key" \
  https://development.integration-api.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk/v1/images/2461788 \
  --cert client.pem \
  --key client.key
```

This will return the image in JPEG format.

<img src="images/example-person-image.jpg" style="border-style: solid; border-color: grey;" alt="an example of a person image">

See [getting an image API endpoint](/documentation/api/#images-id) for more details.
