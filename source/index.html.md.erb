# About

HMPPS Integration API is a RESTFul API that provides a single point of entry for organisations to access data about a
person within the prison and probation services of Ministry of Justice (MOJ) such as the National Offender Management
Information System (NOMIS). It uses a Police National Computer identifier (PNC ID) for a person.
