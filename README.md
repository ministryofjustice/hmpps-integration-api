## About this project

A long-lived API that exposes data from HMPPS systems such as the National Offender Management Information System (
NOMIS), nDelius (probation system) and Offender Assessment System (OASys), providing a single point of entry for
consumers. It's built using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot/) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
as well as the following technologies for its infrastructure:

- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) - Services utilise AWS features through Cloud Platform such
  as [Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) to store our built artifacts. The CI/CD pipeline
  stores and retrieves them from there as required.
- [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/developer) - Used for our build platform, responsible for executing workflows to
  build, validate, test and deploy our project.
- [Cloud Platform](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/#cloud-platform-user-guide) - Ministry of
  Justice's (MoJ) cloud hosting platform built on top of AWS which offers numerous tools such as logging, monitoring and
  alerting for our services.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - The API is built into docker images which are deployed to our containers.
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) - Creates 'pods' to host our environment. Manages auto-scaling, load
  balancing and networking to our application.

## Environments

This API is designed to run in 4 environments:

| Name           | Deployed | Data                                               | Purpose                                           |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Local          | N/A      | Prism Stub                                         | Local Feature Development                         |
| Development    | On Merge | T3/Development Seed                                | Internal Testing                                  |
| Pre-Production | On Merge | Real - copy of live imported every couple of weeks | Internal Testing / QA / External Consumer Testing |
| Production     | Manually | Real                                               | Live Services                                     |

## High Availability
The API is hosted in 1 AWS region (London).
Nodes are spread across multiple (up to 3) Availability Zones.

- eu-west-2a
- eu-west-2b
- eu-west-2c

Healthchecks are run by Kubernetes to assess the health of each node. If a node fails 3 times in a row, it is declared unhealthy and a new one put in to take its place.
Kubernetes with auto heal and prevent any corrupt nodes from replacing existing healthy ones.

## Backups

This is a transient API with no database, no data passing through the API is persisted.

Only the following is persisted:
- Mutual TLS certificate authority - S3 (versioning enabled)
- API container Images - ECR (versioning enabled)

## Security
This service is accessed exclusively through the API and has no other user interfaces.
Onboarding new clients is a manual process and there is no other way to gain access credentials. 
All in-flight requests are encrypted and sent over HTTPS over the public internet. Any data at rest is encrypted with AWS [Key Management Service (KMS)](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/).

IP Restrictions are in place and will prevent the majority of unauthorised access attempts. We do not currently have AWS [WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/) applied on our ingress.
All secrets are stored as Kubernetes secrets.

The tokens provided by HMPPS Auth (to access upstream APIs such as NOMIS) by default last 20 minutes before refresh.
These tokens have limited read-only access to accomplish only tasks required by the API.

Below is a list of protected resources that make up the service, and access levels to those resources.

| Access               | Controlled by                                                 | Limited to                      |

## Getting started

### Using IntelliJ IDEA

When using an IDE like [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), getting started is very simple as it will
handle installing the required Java SDK and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) versions. The following are the steps for
using IntelliJ but other IDEs will prove similar.

1. Clone the repo.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ministryofjustice/hmpps-integration-api.git
```

2. Launch IntelliJ and open the `hmpps-integration-api` project by navigating to the location of the repository.

Upon opening the project, IntelliJ will begin downloading and installing necessary dependencies which may take a few
minutes.

3. Enable pre-commit hooks for formatting and linting code.

```bash
./gradlew addKtlintFormatGitPreCommitHook addKtlintCheckGitPreCommitHook
```

## Usage

### Running the application

To run the application using IntelliJ:

1. Select the `HmppsIntegrationApi` run configuration file.
2. Click the run button.

To run the application using the command line:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

#### With dependent services

It's possible to run the application with dependent services like
the [NOMIS / Prison API](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/prison-api)
and [HMPPS Auth](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-auth) with Docker
using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

1. Build and start the containers for each service.

```bash
make serve
```

Each service is then accessible at:

- [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) for this application
- [http://localhost:4030](http://localhost:4030) for the Prison API
- [http://localhost:4020](http://localhost:4020) for the Probation Offender Search
- [http://localhost:4010](http://localhost:4010) for the Prisoner Offender Search
- [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) for the HMPPS Auth service

As part of getting the HMPPS Auth service running
locally, [the in-memory database is seeded with data including a number of clients](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-auth/blob/main/src/main/resources/db/dev/data/auth/V900_0__clients.sql)
. A client can have different permissions i.e. read, write, reporting, although strangely the column name is
called `​​autoapprove`.

In order to call endpoints of the Prison API, an access token must be provided that is generated from the HMPPS Auth
service.

2. Generate a token for a HMPPS Auth client.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:9090/auth/oauth/token?grant_type=client_credentials" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Basic $(echo -n "prisoner-offender-search-client:clientsecret" | base64)"
```

This uses the client ID: `prisoner-offender-search-client` and the client secret: `clientsecret`. A number of seeded
clients use the same client secret.

A JWT token is returned as a result, it will look like this:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs ...BAtWD653XpCzn8A",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3599,
  "scope": "read write",
  "sub": "prisoner-offender-search-client",
  "auth_source": "none",
  "jti": "Ptr-MIdUBDGDOl8_qqeIuNV9Wpc",
  "iss": "http://localhost:9090/auth/issuer"
}
```

Using the value of `access_token`, you can call the Prison API using it as a Bearer Token.

There are a couple of options for calling the Prison API such as [curl](https://curl.se/)
, [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and using in-built Swagger UI via the browser
at [http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui/index.html) which documents the
available API endpoints.

### Running the tests

The testing framework used in this project is [Kotest](https://kotest.io/).

To run the tests using IntelliJ:

1. Install the [Kotest IntelliJ plugin](https://kotest.io/docs/intellij/intellij-plugin.html).

This provides the ability to easily run a test as it provides run buttons (gutter icons) next to each test and test
file.

2. Click the run button beside a test or test file.

To run all tests using the command line:

```bash
make test
```

To run unit tests using the command line:

```bash
make unit-test
```

To run smoke tests using the command line:

```bash
make smoke-test
```

### Running the linter

To lint the code using [Ktlint](https://pinterest.github.io/ktlint/):

```bash
make lint
```

To autofix any styling issues with the code:

```bash
make format
```

### Running all checks

To run all the tests and linting:

```bash
make check
```

### Request Logging

This can be done within `logback-spring.xml`. To enable request logging, update the value of the `level` property within
the logger named `<application>.config.RequestLogger` to the
desired [logger level](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.1.13.RELEASE/reference/html/boot-features-logging.html)
.

```xml

<logger name="uk.gov.justice.digital.hmpps.hmppsintegrationapi.config.RequestLogger" additivity="false" level="DEBUG">
    <appender-ref ref="logAppender"/>
    <appender-ref ref="consoleAppender"/>
</logger>
```

Note, this will only specifically enable the `RequestLogger`.
