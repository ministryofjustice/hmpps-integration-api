# 0004 - Lists returned with root JSON object

2023-02-21

## Status

Accepted

## Context

It is common for a number of endpoints to return a list of objects (person images is an example of this). Either an array can be returned as the response, or it can be wrapped within a JSON root object.

_Array Response_
```
[
  {
    "firstName" : "John"
    "lastName" : "Smith"
  },
  {
    "firstName" : "Sue"
    "lastName" : "Storm"
  }
]
```

_Wrapped in a JSON Object_
```
{
  "persons" : 
  [
    {
      "firstName" : "John",
      "lastName" : "Smith"
    },
    {
      "firstName" : "Sue",
      "lastName" : "Storm"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Decision

We have decided that all responses will be wrapped within a JSON object. This gives us more flexibility should we need to make adjustments to the object's schema.

If we responded with an array. Let's say we needed to add an additional property to the response, this would change the data type of the response and therefore break consumers.

This also makes our API easier to use; Consumers do not need to build cases to support a response sometimes being an Array, and other times being a JSON object.


## Consequences

1. Consideration will need to be taken when building controllers to respond with the correct type.
2. When responding with only a list of data. The data will need to be wrapped into a JSON object.
