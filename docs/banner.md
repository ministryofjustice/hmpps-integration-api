# Banner

The banner for hmpps-integration-api is simply composed of ASCII text characters. It was originally generated within
the free to download software [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). The `.svg` file generated from this software has been 
provided alongside banner.txt for anyone who wishes to update it.

From Inkscape, you will need to export an image type such as a `.png`. This will then need to be passed into 
[ASCII Art](https://asciiart.club/). From here the text representation of the image can be used in banner.txt.
