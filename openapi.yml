    get:
      tags:
        - needs
      summary: >
        Returns criminogenic needs associated with a person.

        Note: Criminogenic needs are dynamic factors that are directly linked to criminal behaviour. Eight criminogenic needs are measured in OASys: Accommodation, Employability, Relationships, Lifestyle and Associates, Drug Misuse, Alcohol Misuse, Thinking & Behaviour and Attitudes. These are scored according to whether there is “no need”, “some need” or “severe need”, and a need is identified in a specific section based on calculations around these scores.
              However, the process by which needs are assessed is changing as early as next year (2024), specifically moving to a strength-based model that seeks to identify and develop the strengths of people with convictions. As a consequence of this, the information provided by this endpoint will also change.
