# Get started

## Request access

Email [hmpps-external-api@justice.gov.uk](mailto:hmpps-external-api@justice.gov.uk) to request access to this API.

Once access has been agreed you will need a client certificate for mTLS authentication. To start this process you will
send a Certificate Signing Request (CSR), generated with the following command
(replacing placeholders with agreed values):-

```
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:3072 -noenc -keyout {consumername}_{env}_private_key.pem -subj=/O={consumerorg}/CN={consumerame} -out {consumername}_{env}.csr
```

You will send the CSR (but NOT the private key) to us at the email address above, and we will send back your
client certificate and API key.

For information on how to use these credentials, see our [Authentication](/authentication.html) section.

**If approved you will be granted a specific role that defines which API endpoints you have access to, and what data is included in the responses**.

All roles provide access to a `/status` endpoint that can be used to verify connectivity and authentication.

## Explore Available Endpoints

Please review the available [endpoints](../api/index.html), and let us know what data you require when you get in contact.
We provide API access on an endpoint by endpoint basis, and may also filter or redact parts of the responses.authentication

Different endpoints provide data controlled by different owners within MoJ, and access to each endpoint is at the discretion
of the relevant data owner. In most cases a Data Sharing Agreement and/or Data Protection Impact Assessment will be required.

Be sure to allow sufficient time for the approvals process to complete. The wider the scope of the access request, the
longer this process may take.

Please contact us at [hmpps-external-api@justice.gov.uk](mailto:hmpps-external-api@justice.gov.uk)
for futher details.
