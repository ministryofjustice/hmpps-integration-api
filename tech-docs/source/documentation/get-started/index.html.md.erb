# Get started

## Request access

Email [hmpps-integration-api@justice.gov.uk](mailto:hmpps-integration-api@justice.gov.uk) to request access to this API and Events.

All requests will be manually approved.

**If approved you will be granted a specific role that defines which API endpoints you have access to, and what data is included in the responses**.

All roles provide access to a `/status` endpoint that can be used to verify connectivity and authentication.

You may also request access to our non-live environment for testing purposes.

You will receive access credentials including:

1. API Key
2. Client Certificate

For information on how to use these credentials, see our [Authentication](/authentication.html) section.

## Explore Available Endpoints

Please review the available [endpoints](../api/index.html), and let us know what data you require when you get in contact.
We provide API access on an endpoint by endpoint basis. **You might not receive access to all the endpoints you request**.

Please contact us at [hmpps-integration-api@justice.gov.uk](mailto:hmpps-integration-api@justice.gov.uk)
to get a better understanding of what access we are likely to provide.
